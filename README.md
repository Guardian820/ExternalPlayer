Opens YouTube videos and playlists in mpv, and nukes the crappy YouTube player.

Installation:

1. Be on Linux
2. Install youtube-dl and mpv
3. Add [this script]() to your PATH somewhere
4. Install the xpi in this directory

If you want to hack on this, it's a jetpack add on and works like you'd expect if you know how jetpack add ons work.
